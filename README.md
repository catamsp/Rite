## ✨ Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🌐 Works Everywhere
Integrates at the system level via Android's Accessibility Service. Works in **any app** — messaging, email, social media, notes, browsers, and more.

### ⚡ Instant Inline Replacement
Type, trigger, done. The AI response replaces your text directly in the same field — no copy-pasting, no app switching. A spinner (`◐ ◓ ◑ ◒`) shows progress.

### 🔑 Multi-Key Rotation
Add multiple API keys for automatic round-robin rotation. If one key hits a rate limit, SwiftSlate seamlessly switches to the next.

### 🌙 AMOLED Dark Theme
Pure black (`#000000`) Material 3 interface designed for OLED screens — saves battery and looks stunning.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🤖 Powered by Gemini & Custom Providers
Ships with Google's Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite` or `gemini-3-flash-preview`). Or connect **any OpenAI-compatible endpoint** — use your own provider, model, and base URL.

### 🎨 Custom Commands
Create your own trigger → prompt pairs. Define `?poem` to turn text into poetry, `?eli5` to simplify for a five-year-old, or anything you can imagine.

### 🔒 Encrypted Key Storage
API keys are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** using the Android Keystore. Your keys never leave your device unencrypted.

### 🛡️ Privacy-First
No analytics. No telemetry. No intermediary servers. Text is sent directly to the configured provider's API and only when a trigger is detected.

## 🧩 Built-in Commands

SwiftSlate ships with **9 commands** plus dynamic translation — ready to use out of the box:

| Trigger | Action | Example |
|:--------|:-------|:--------|
| **`?fix`** | Fix grammar, spelling & punctuation | `i dont no whats hapening` → `I don't know what's happening.` |
| **`?improve`** | Improve clarity and readability | `The thing is not working good` → `The feature isn't functioning properly.` |
| **`?shorten`** | Shorten while keeping meaning | `I wanted to let you know that I will not be able to attend the meeting tomorrow` → `I can't attend tomorrow's meeting.` |
| **`?expand`** | Expand with more detail | `Meeting postponed` → `The meeting has been postponed to a later date. We will share the updated schedule soon.` |
| **`?formal`** | Rewrite in professional tone | `hey can u send me that file` → `Could you please share the file at your earliest convenience?` |
| **`?casual`** | Rewrite in friendly tone | `Please confirm your attendance at the event` → `Hey, you coming to the event? Let me know!` |
| **`?emoji`** | Add relevant emojis | `I love this new feature` → `I love this new feature! 🎉❤️✨` |
| **`?reply`** | Generate a contextual reply | `Do you want to grab lunch tomorrow?` → `Sure, I'd love to! What time works for you?` |
| **`?undo`** | Restore text from before the last replacement | Reverts to your original text before AI modified it |
| **`?translate:XX`** | Translate to any language | `Hello, how are you?` **`?translate:es`** → `Hola, ¿cómo estás?` |

<details>
<summary>🌍 <strong>Supported language codes for translation</strong></summary>

<br>

Use any standard language code with `?translate:XX`:

| Code | Language | Code | Language | Code | Language |
|:-----|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-----|:---------|

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|:------------|:--------|
| **Android Device** | Android 6.0+ (API 23 or higher) |
| **API Key** | Free Gemini key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com), or a key from any OpenAI-compatible provider |

### Installation

> [!TIP]
> The APK is only ~1.3 MB — lightweight with zero external dependencies for networking or JSON.

**1.** Download the latest APK from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Musheer360/SwiftSlate/releases/latest) page

**2.** Install the APK on your device (allow installation from unknown sources if prompted)

**3.** Open SwiftSlate and follow the setup below

### Setup in 3 Steps

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" align="center">

**Step 1**

🔑 **Add API Key**

Open the **Keys** tab, enter your API key. It's validated before saving. Add multiple keys for rotation.

</td>

**Step 2**

♿ **Enable Service**

On the **Dashboard**, tap **"Enable"** → find **"SwiftSlate Assistant"** in Accessibility Settings → toggle it on.

</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">

**Step 3**

✍️ **Start Typing!**

```

<details>
<summary>🔧 <strong>Technical deep-dive</strong></summary>

<br>

1. **Event Listening** — SwiftSlate registers an Accessibility Service that listens for `TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED` events across all apps
2. **Fast Exit Optimization** — For performance, it first checks if the last character of typed text matches any known trigger's last character before doing a full scan
3. **Longest Match** — When a potential match is found, it searches for the longest matching trigger at the end of the text
4. **Text Extraction** — The text before the trigger is extracted and paired with the command's prompt
5. **API Call** — The text + prompt is sent to the configured AI provider using the next available key in the round-robin rotation
6. **Inline Spinner** — While waiting for the response, a spinner animation (`◐ ◓ ◑ ◒`) replaces the text to provide visual feedback
7. **Text Replacement** — The AI response replaces the original text using `ACTION_SET_TEXT`
8. **Fallback Strategy** — If `ACTION_SET_TEXT` fails (some apps don't support it), SwiftSlate falls back to a clipboard-based paste approach

</details>

<br>

## 🎨 Custom Commands

Go beyond the built-ins — create your own trigger → prompt pairs in the **Commands** tab.

### How to Create One

1. Open the **Commands** screen
2. Enter a **Trigger** (e.g., `?poem`)
3. Enter a **Prompt** — the instruction sent to the AI
4. Tap **"Add Command"**

### Example Ideas

| Trigger | Prompt | Use Case |
|:--------|:-------|:---------|
| `?eli5` | `Explain this like I'm five years old and return ONLY the modified text.` | Simplify complex topics |
| `?bullet` | `Convert this text into bullet points and return ONLY the modified text.` | Quick formatting |
| `?headline` | `Rewrite this as a catchy headline and return ONLY the modified text.` | Social media posts |
| `?code` | `Convert this description into pseudocode and return ONLY the modified text.` | Developer shorthand |
| `?tldr` | `Summarize this text in one sentence and return ONLY the modified text.` | Quick summaries |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always include **"return ONLY the modified text"** in your prompt to ensure clean output without extra commentary from the AI.

<br>

## 🔑 API Key Management

SwiftSlate supports multiple API keys with intelligent rotation:

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| **Round-Robin Rotation** | Keys are used in turn to spread usage evenly across all configured keys |
| **Rate-Limit Handling** | If a key gets rate-limited (HTTP 429), SwiftSlate tracks the cooldown and skips it automatically |
| **Invalid Key Detection** | Keys returning 403 errors are marked invalid and excluded from rotation |
| **Encrypted Storage** | All keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM via Android Keystore before being saved locally |

> [!TIP]
> Adding **2–3 API keys** helps avoid rate limits during heavy use. Each API key has its own quota.

<br>

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

> [!NOTE]
> SwiftSlate is built with privacy as a **core architectural principle**, not an afterthought.

| | Concern | How SwiftSlate Handles It |
|:--|:--------|:------------------------|
| 👁️ | **Text Monitoring** | Only processes text when a trigger command is detected at the end. All other typing is completely ignored. |
| 📡 | **Data Transmission** | Text is sent **only** to the configured AI provider (Google Gemini or your custom endpoint). No other servers are ever contacted. |
| 🔐 | **Key Storage** | API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using the Android Keystore system before being saved locally. |
| 📊 | **Analytics** | **None.** Zero telemetry, zero tracking, zero crash reporting. |
| 📖 | **Open Source** | The entire codebase is open for inspection under the MIT License. |
| 🔑 | **Permissions** | Only requires the Accessibility Service permission — nothing else. |
