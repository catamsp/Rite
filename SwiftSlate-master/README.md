## ✨ Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🌐 Works Almost Everywhere
Integrates at the system level via Android's Accessibility Service. Works in **most apps** — messaging, email, social media, notes, browsers, and more. Some apps with custom input fields may not be supported ([see limitations](#%EF%B8%8F-known-limitations)).

### ⚡ Instant Inline Replacement
Type, trigger, done. The AI response replaces your text directly in the same field — no copy-pasting, no app switching. A spinner (`◐ ◓ ◑ ◒`) shows progress for AI commands; text replacer commands execute instantly.

### 🔑 Multi-Key Rotation
Add multiple API keys for automatic round-robin rotation. If one key hits a rate limit, SwiftSlate seamlessly switches to the next.

### 🌙 AMOLED Dark Theme
Pure black (`#000000`) Material 3 interface designed for OLED screens — saves battery and looks stunning. Light theme also included.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🤖 Multi-Provider AI
Ships with Google Gemini, Groq, or connect **any OpenAI-compatible endpoint** — cloud providers, or **local LLMs** like [Ollama](https://ollama.com), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), and others running on your network.

### 🛠️ Two Command Types
**AI commands** send text to your provider for intelligent transformation. **Text replacer commands** run entirely offline for instant local text manipulation — no API key needed.

### 🔒 Encrypted Key Storage
API keys are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** using the Android Keystore. Your keys never leave your device unencrypted.

### 🌍 Localized in 7 Languages
App UI available in English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese (BR), Hindi, and Simplified Chinese.

## 🧩 Built-in Commands

SwiftSlate ships with **10 AI-powered commands** plus dynamic translation — ready to use out of the box:

| Trigger | Action | Example |
|:--------|:-------|:--------|
| **`?fix`** | Fix grammar, spelling & punctuation | `i dont no whats hapening` → `I don't know what's happening.` |
| **`?improve`** | Improve clarity and readability | `The thing is not working good` → `The feature isn't functioning properly.` |
| **`?shorten`** | Shorten while keeping meaning | `I wanted to let you know that I will not be able to attend the meeting tomorrow` → `I can't attend tomorrow's meeting.` |
| **`?expand`** | Expand with more detail | `Meeting postponed` → `The meeting has been postponed to a later date. We will share the updated schedule soon.` |
| **`?formal`** | Rewrite in professional tone | `hey can u send me that file` → `Could you please share the file at your earliest convenience?` |
| **`?casual`** | Rewrite in friendly tone | `Please confirm your attendance at the event` → `Hey, you coming to the event? Let me know!` |
| **`?emoji`** | Add relevant emojis | `I love this new feature` → `I love this new feature! 🎉❤️✨` |
| **`?human`** | Humanize AI-generated text | `I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to delve into...` → `Hope you're doing well. I wanted to dig into...` |
| **`?reply`** | Generate a contextual reply | `Do you want to grab lunch tomorrow?` → `Sure, I'd love to! What time works for you?` |
| **`?undo`** | Restore text from before the last replacement | Reverts to your original text before AI modified it |
| **`?translate:XX`** | Translate to any language | `Hello, how are you?` **`?translate:es`** → `Hola, ¿cómo estás?` |

<details>
<summary>🌍 <strong>Supported language codes for translation</strong></summary>

<br>

Use any standard language code with `?translate:XX`:

| Code | Language | Code | Language | Code | Language |
|:-----|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-----|:---------|
| `es` | Spanish | `fr` | French | `de` | German |
| `ja` | Japanese | `ko` | Korean | `zh` | Chinese |
| `hi` | Hindi | `ar` | Arabic | `pt` | Portuguese |
| `it` | Italian | `ru` | Russian | `nl` | Dutch |
| `tr` | Turkish | `pl` | Polish | `sv` | Swedish |

…and many more. Any ISO 639 language code works — the AI model handles it.

</details>

<br>

## 🛠️ Text Replacer Commands

Beyond AI, you can create **text replacer commands** that run **entirely offline** — no API key, no network, instant execution:

| Use Case | Trigger | Replacement | Result |
|:---------|:--------|:------------|:-------|
| **Signatures** | `?sig` | `— John Doe, CEO` | Appends your signature |
| **Canned responses** | `?ty` | `Thank you for reaching out! I'll get back to you shortly.` | Instant reply template |
| **Snippets** | `?addr` | `123 Main St, Springfield, IL 62701` | Quick address insertion |
| **Shortcuts** | `?email` | `contact@example.com` | Fast email insertion |

> [!TIP]
> Text replacer commands execute instantly with zero latency — no spinner, no network call. Create them in the **Commands** tab by selecting the **"Text Replacer"** type.

<br>

## 🤖 Supported AI Providers

| Provider | Models | Notes |
|:---------|:-------|:------|
| **Google Gemini** (default) | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` | Free tier available at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) |
| **Groq** | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` | Free tier at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys) |
| **Custom (OpenAI-compatible)** | Any model your endpoint supports | Works with Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, any `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint |

> [!TIP]
> For local LLMs, set the endpoint to your machine's local address (e.g., `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama). HTTP is allowed for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `10.0.2.2`.

<br>

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|:------------|:--------|
| **Android Device** | Android 6.0+ (API 23 or higher) |
| **API Key** | Free Gemini key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com), or a key from Groq / any OpenAI-compatible provider. *Not required for text replacer commands.* |

### Installation

> [!TIP]
> The APK is only ~1.2 MB — lightweight with zero external dependencies for networking or JSON.

**1.** Download the latest APK from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Musheer360/SwiftSlate/releases/latest) page

**2.** Install the APK on your device (allow installation from unknown sources if prompted)

```

<details>
<summary>🔧 <strong>Technical deep-dive</strong></summary>

<br>

1. **Event Listening** — SwiftSlate registers an Accessibility Service that listens for `TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED` events across all apps (ignoring its own UI and password fields)
2. **Fast Exit Optimization** — For performance, it first checks if the last character of typed text matches any known trigger's last character before doing a full scan
3. **Longest Match** — When a potential match is found, it searches for the longest matching trigger at the end of the text
4. **Command Routing** — Text replacer commands execute immediately on-device. AI commands proceed to the API call path
5. **API Call** — The text + prompt is sent to the configured AI provider using the next available key in the round-robin rotation
6. **Inline Spinner** — While waiting for the AI response, a spinner animation (`◐ ◓ ◑ ◒`) replaces the text to provide visual feedback
7. **Watchdog Timer** — A 120-second safety timer auto-cancels stuck processing jobs to prevent the service from becoming unresponsive
8. **Text Replacement** — The response replaces the original text using `ACTION_SET_TEXT`
9. **Fallback Strategy** — If `ACTION_SET_TEXT` fails (some apps don't support it), SwiftSlate falls back to a clipboard-based select-all + paste approach
10. **Post-Replace Verification** — A delayed check ensures the IME didn't clobber the replacement, re-applying if needed
11. **Bounded Responses** — API responses are capped at 1 MB to prevent memory issues from malformed responses

</details>

<br>

## 🎨 Custom Commands

Create, edit, and manage your own commands in the **Commands** tab.

### Two Types of Custom Commands

| Type | How It Works | Needs API Key? | Latency |
|:-----|:-------------|:---------------|:--------|
| **AI** | Sends text to your AI provider with your custom prompt | Yes | ~1–3 seconds |
| **Text Replacer** | Replaces the trigger with a fixed string, entirely offline | No | Instant |

### Example AI Command Ideas

| Trigger | Prompt | Use Case |
|:--------|:-------|:---------|
| `?eli5` | `Explain this like I'm five years old.` | Simplify complex topics |
| `?bullet` | `Convert this text into bullet points.` | Quick formatting |
| `?headline` | `Rewrite this as a catchy headline.` | Social media posts |
| `?code` | `Convert this description into pseudocode.` | Developer shorthand |
| `?tldr` | `Summarize this text in one sentence.` | Quick summaries |

> [!TIP]
> Just describe the transformation you want — SwiftSlate's system instruction automatically ensures the AI returns only the transformed text without extra commentary.

<br>

## 🔑 API Key Management

SwiftSlate supports multiple API keys with intelligent rotation:

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| **Round-Robin Rotation** | Keys are used in turn to spread usage evenly across all configured keys |
| **Rate-Limit Handling** | If a key gets rate-limited (HTTP 429), SwiftSlate tracks the cooldown and skips it automatically |
| **Invalid Key Detection** | Keys returning 401/403 errors are marked invalid and excluded from rotation |
| **Encrypted Storage** | All keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM via Android Keystore before being saved locally |
| **Live Validation** | Keys are validated against the provider's API before being saved |

> [!TIP]
> Adding **2–3 API keys from different accounts** helps avoid rate limits during heavy use. On the free tier, all keys under the same account share a single quota — so rotation only helps with keys from separate accounts.

<br>

## 💾 Backup & Restore

Export and import your custom commands as JSON files — useful for migrating to a new device or sharing command sets.

- **Export** — Saves all custom commands to a `.json` file via Android's file picker
- **Import** — Loads commands from a `.json` file (validates format, trigger prefix, and size limits before importing)

Find both options in the **Settings** tab under **Backup & Restore**.

> [!NOTE]
> Imported commands must use the same trigger prefix currently configured in the app. API keys are **not** included in backups for security.

<br>

## 🌍 Localization

SwiftSlate's UI is available in **7 languages**:

| Language | Code |
|:---------|:-----|
| 🇺🇸 English | `en` |
| 🇫🇷 French | `fr` |
| 🇩🇪 German | `de` |
| 🇪🇸 Spanish | `es` |
| 🇧🇷 Portuguese (Brazil) | `pt-rBR` |
| 🇮🇳 Hindi | `hi` |
| 🇨🇳 Simplified Chinese | `zh-rCN` |

The app automatically uses your device's language. Contributions for additional translations are welcome!

<br>

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

> [!NOTE]
> SwiftSlate is built with privacy as a **core architectural principle**, not an afterthought.

| | Concern | How SwiftSlate Handles It |
|:--|:--------|:------------------------|
| 👁️ | **Text Monitoring** | Only processes text when a trigger command is detected at the end. All other typing is completely ignored. Password fields are always skipped. |
| 📡 | **Data Transmission** | Text is sent **only** to the configured AI provider (Google Gemini, Groq, or your custom endpoint). No other servers are ever contacted. Text replacer commands never leave your device. |
| 🔐 | **Key Storage** | API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using the Android Keystore system. Encryption failures throw rather than falling back to plaintext. |
| 📊 | **Analytics** | **None.** Zero telemetry, zero tracking, zero crash reporting. |
| 📖 | **Open Source** | The entire codebase is open for inspection under the MIT License. |
| 🔑 | **Permissions** | Only requires the Accessibility Service permission — nothing else. |
| 💾 | **Backups** | API keys and settings are excluded from Android cloud backups and device transfers. |

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Some apps use custom input fields** that don't support Android's standard text replacement APIs. SwiftSlate includes a clipboard-based fallback, but apps like **WeChat** and **Chrome's address bar** may still not work. Most standard text fields (messaging apps, email composers, notes, etc.) work fine.
- **Some OEMs restrict accessibility services.** Certain manufacturers (e.g., OnePlus, Xiaomi) may hide or block third-party accessibility services in their settings UI. If SwiftSlate doesn't appear in your accessibility settings, check for a "Downloaded apps" or "Installed services" section, or try searching for it.
